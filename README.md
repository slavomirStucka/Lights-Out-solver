# Lights Out Solver

## Overview
This project solves the **Lights Out** puzzle using three algorithms: A*, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Greedy Search. The goal is to turn off all the lights in the grid by using the most efficient algorithm. This project was developed in collaboration with a classmate.

## Features
- Implementation of A*, DFS, and Greedy Search algorithms
- Comparison of algorithm performance
- Optimized solution paths

## Usage
1. Run the solver script.
2. Choose an algorithm and input the puzzle grid.
3. View the steps to solve the puzzle and performance metrics.
